## Project Overview

WildfireCatch is an AI-driven wildfire detection and response system designed to identify wildfires in real-time using machine learning models trained on geospatial remote sensing images. This project integrates various technologies to provide features such as real-time notifications, fire spread prediction, dynamic mapping, safety tips through a chatbot, and coordination with drones for enhanced accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-time Wildfire Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to detect wildfires from satellite imagery.
- **Fire Spread Prediction**: Predicts the potential spread of detected wildfires.
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Provides real-time maps highlighting affected areas.
- **Safety Tips and Disaster Management**: Integrated chatbot using Gemini Pro to offer safety tips and disaster management guidelines.
- **Drone Coordination**: Enhances detection accuracy through drone integration.
- **Notification System**: Sends real-time alerts and updates to users.

## Technologies Used

- **WildfireCatch - Wildfire Detection and Response System**:
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
  - **Backend**: Django, MapTiler API, Leaflet.js
  - **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Python
  - **Database**: SQLite
  - **Deployment**: Azure

Implemented a real-time wildfire detection system using TensorFlow and Python for machine learning model development, integrated with geospatial remote sensing images. Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Django, MapTiler API, and Leaflet.js for frontend and backend development, enabling dynamic mapping and visual representation of fire locations and safety zones. Integrated SQLite for database management and deployed the system on Azure.
